### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as tech art director in the video games industry in sunny Singapore

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in procedural generation, UX, HCI and real-time rendering

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: game development, project management, software engineering

ğŸ˜„ Tech: mostly UE5, Houdini, Blender, Python, C / C++, and Vex (but sometimes Go, Java, C#, MaxScript, SQL and MongoDB)

âš¡ Geeky hobbies: I enjoy retro computing, owning an Amiga 3000, an 68k Mac, a NeXT station and an old 486 PC for some DOS gaming.
