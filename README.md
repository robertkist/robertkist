### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on art pipeline solutions for games like League, TFT and Valorant

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more Houdini and Vex. I also work on an Ultima III style RPG in my spare time.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: game development, project management, software engineering

ðŸ˜„ Languages: Python, C, Vex, (some) C++, (some) Go, (some) Kotlin, (a bit of) Java, (less and less) MaxScript

âš¡ Fun fact: I collect old computers. I own an Amiga 3000, a 128k Mac and a NeXT Station
