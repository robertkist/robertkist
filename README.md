### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as tech art director in the video games industry in sunny Singapore

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in procedural generation, UX, HCI and real-time rendering

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: game development, project management, software engineering

ðŸ˜„ Tech: mostly UE5, Houdini, Blender, Python, C / C++, and Vex (but sometimes Go, Java, C#, MaxScript, SQL and MongoDB)

âš¡ Geeky hobbies: I enjoy retro computing, owning an A3000 (BFG9060, XSurf100, ZZ9000), a 128k Mac, a Quadra 610 (with a rare Sonnet 68040@50 QuadDoubler), a Colour Classic, a no-name 486 PC (but with a neat LAPC-I sound card) and a NeXT station. I'm also trying to develop a game for Panic's Playdate handheld in my spare time to sharpen my C programming skills.
