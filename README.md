### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on tools and pipeline solutions for games like League, TFT and Valorant

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in procedural generation, UX, HCI and real-time rendering

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: game development, project management, software engineering

ðŸ˜„ Tech: mostly UE5, Houdini, Blender, Python, C / C++, and Vex (but sometimes Go, Java, C#, MaxScript, SQL and MongoDB)

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy retro computing, owning an A3000, a 128k Mac, a Quadra 610 and a NeXT station
