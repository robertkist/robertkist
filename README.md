### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on tools and pipeline solutions for games like League, TFT and Valorant

🌱 I’m interested in procedural generation, UX, HCI and real-time rendering.

💬 Ask me about: game development, project management, software engineering

😄 Tech: mostly UE5, Houdini, Python, C / C++, and Vex (but sometimes Go, Java, SQL and MongoDB)

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy retro computing, owning an A3000, a 128k Mac, a Quadra 610 and a NeXT station
