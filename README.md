### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working as tech art director in the video games industry in sunny Singapore

🌱 I’m interested in procedural generation, UX, HCI and real-time rendering

💬 Ask me about: game development, project management, software engineering

😄 Tech: mostly UE5, Houdini, Blender, Python, C / C++, and Vex (but sometimes Go, Java, C#, MEL, shell scripts, MaxScript, SQL and MongoDB)

🐱 Management: I'm interested in product management, Agile and organisational psychology (ever wondered why your workplace is how it is?)

⚡ Geeky hobbies: I enjoy retro computing, owning an Amiga 3000, an 68k Mac, a NeXT station and an old 486 PC for some DOS gaming.

🎮 Games: Skyrim, AC, Monkey Island, WoW, Baldur's Gate, Ultima, Civ and all stuff running on ScummVM 

🍎 I'm a Mac user! (there's a term in the EULA that requires that Mac users tell everyone else they're using a Mac. sorry)

⭐ If you like my software, you don't have to buy me a coffee, but you could star my repos 😄
