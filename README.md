### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working as tech art director in the video games industry in sunny Singapore

😄 Tech: mostly UE5, Houdini, Blender, Python, C / C++, and Vex (but sometimes Go, Java, C#, MEL, shell scripts, MaxScript, SQL and MongoDB)

⚡ Geeky hobbies: I enjoy retro computing. I own an Amiga 3000, a 68k Mac, a NeXT station and an old 486 PC.

🎮 Games: CRPGs, MMORPGs, Skyrim, AC, Monkey Island, WoW, Baldur's Gate, Ultima, Civ and all stuff running on ScummVM. 

⭐ If you like my software, you don't have to buy me a coffee, but you could star my repos. Thank you! 😄
